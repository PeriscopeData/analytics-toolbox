# Periscope Analytics Toolbox

Code examples for Data Analysts and Data Scientists by the Periscope community and support team.

Our code examples are broken up into four different folders to help you quickly find what you are looking for:

  1. Python
  2. R
  3. SQL
  4. Datasets

Within each folder there is a README.md file that details the projects within the folder.  You can quickly scan this to document to verify that the example you are looking for is there.
