<h4>What pro sport should you play?</h4>

As a Canadian I was always amazed at some of the salaries baseball or football players we're able to get (Jason Heyward getting 21 million year? He plays outfield right?), especially compared to Hockey (one of the best players currently Sidney Crosby getting only 8.7 million). So after hours one day at work, I wanted to actually compare salaries of the four major professional sports in North America (Football, Baseball, Basketball, and Hockey). So I grabbed salary (well cap hit) information for the top 500 players in each league from  <http://www.spotrac.com/> , and graphed it in millions (See attached).

So maybe the NHL doesn't have those extreme salaries, but if you're ok with a couple million, it's still alright :)

Used beautiful soup to extract the information, can share the code if anyone is interested.
